## Singleton is **EVERYWHERE**

If you are quite familiar with bunch of apple's frameworks such as [UserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults), [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession), [FileManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager), [UIApplication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication) and [NSApplication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication), You can see and use those of **singleton patterns** quite frequently.

## What is **Singleton Patterns**?

Singleton actually means "**You can instanciate class only once** and use shared property instead of instance of class".

<!-- more -->

In Swift (and unlike Java) you can **really easily** make singleton class.

Let's check the code!

```
class SingletonClass {

    static let shared = SingletonClass()
    
    private init() { }
}
```

That's it! You can use and **share** data singleton class has from anywhere because anyone can uses singleton class's shared property as a **global**.

and from now you can't instanciate this class like below

> let singleton = SingletonClass()

but use like below instead

> SingletonClass.**shared**

## Pros and Cons

Singleton pattern has some of pros and cons.

### Pros
1. You can share data between classes and views (and more...)
2. You don't need spend a time to load the class because if you use singleton class, that class is already loaded
3. You don't waste **memory** to load class
4. You can share data from anywhere

### Cons
1. If you don't take care of thread-safe approciatly, **Your singleton class can be instanciated TWICE**.
2. If singleton class shares a lot of data with another class's method, That's violation of OCP(Open Closed Principle)
3. Sacrificing Transparency for Convenience

Some of intermediated developers are saying about cons of using singleton pattern though, Singleton pattern still gives us convenience of accessibility.
