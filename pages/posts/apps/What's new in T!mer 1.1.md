First, T!mer is imporved haptic feedback! Now, you can feel more accurate and sensitive haptip feedback :)
[Haptic Feedback](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/haptics/) is one of powerful features in apple devices (iPhone, Apple Watch). I personally really love to use haptic feedback. Thus it's **accurate and wonderful**! So we don't have reason to not use haptic feedback :)

Second, I made new feedback button in setting page.
You can send feedback to my email address through just ***Button*** :)
**Feel free to send email to me whenever** haha

And email is opened to anybody and about any topics, So don't hesitate to send email to me :)

Bye 'till next time 👍🏻
