Hi, I'm Kriemben. T!mer 1.2.0 is released on [app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t-mer/id1497422473?ls=1)!

First, T!mer has **MORE** notification sounds! I selected sounds and will load to app.

Second, from ver. 1.2.0, You can see "What is new" update logs. It's simple feature, but necessary i think.

Third, I added "Some tips" menu. This is for who still doesn't know how to use T!mer. So check it. As you can see, T!mer is quite simple app **untill now** so you can use T!mer easily and fastly like [Han-gul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul)

Next update session will be 3rd week of may but it may not accurate.
